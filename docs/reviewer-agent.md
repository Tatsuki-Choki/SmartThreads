# SmartThreads Reviewer Agent

## Overview

The SmartThreads Reviewer Agent is a specialized quality assurance tool built on Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) that provides comprehensive application validation and testing capabilities. This agent operates exclusively in review mode, ensuring code quality and user experience without making any code modifications.

## Agent Architecture

### Core Philosophy
- **Review-Only Operations**: Never modifies code, only provides analysis and recommendations
- **Mobile-First Testing**: Optimized for iOS/Android browser experiences
- **Continuous Quality Assurance**: Automated validation of application health and performance
- **Requirement Compliance**: Validates against SmartThreads specification requirements

### Technical Components

#### 1. Playwright MCP Integration
- **Browser Engine**: Chromium with mobile emulation
- **Viewport**: iPhone-optimized (375x812px)
- **User Agent**: iOS Safari simulation
- **Network Conditions**: Configurable for various connection types

#### 2. Testing Scenarios

##### Critical Priority Tests
- **Application Startup**: Verifies successful app initialization and main page load
- **Core Functionality**: Tests primary user workflows and feature availability
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitors against defined thresholds (LCP < 2.5s, TTI < 3s)

##### High Priority Tests  
- **UI Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design validation and touch interaction testing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection and analysis
- **Visual Regression**: Screenshot-based UI consistency verification

##### Medium Priority Tests
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG AA validation and screen reader support
- **Security Validation**: Basic security header and CSP checks
- **Internationalization**: Locale-specific formatting and timezone handling

#### 3. Performance Thresholds

```json
{
  "lcp": 2500,      // Largest Contentful Paint (ms)
  "tti": 3000,      // Time to Interactive (ms) 
  "cls": 0.1,       // Cumulative Layout Shift
  "fcp": 1500       // First Contentful Paint (ms)
}
```

## Usage Guide

### Manual Review Execution

```bash
# Trigger comprehensive review
/review

# Trigger specific scenario
/review scenario:application_startup

# Run critical tests only
/review priority:critical
```

### Automated Triggers

#### File Change Monitoring (Optional)
```json
{
  "onFileChange": {
    "enabled": false,
    "patterns": ["src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.ts", "public/**/*"],
    "debounce": 5000
  }
}
```

#### Pre-Commit Hooks (Optional)
```json
{
  "preCommit": {
    "enabled": false,
    "runCriticalOnly": true
  }
}
```

## Test Scenarios Detail

### 1. Application Startup Validation
- Verifies application starts without errors
- Checks main page load performance
- Validates PWA manifest configuration
- Confirms mobile optimization settings

### 2. UI/UX Responsiveness Testing
- Tests touch interactions and gestures
- Verifies single-handed operation design
- Checks viewport scaling behavior
- Tests orientation change handling

### 3. Core Functionality Validation
- Tests navigation flow completeness
- Verifies form interactions and validation
- Checks error handling and user feedback
- Tests offline capabilities (PWA features)

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Measures Web Vitals metrics
- Monitors network request efficiency
- Tracks JavaScript bundle performance
- Validates caching strategies

### 5. Accessibility Compliance
- Validates semantic HTML structure
- Checks ARIA labels and roles
- Tests keyboard navigation paths
- Validates color contrast ratios

## Report Generation

### Output Formats

#### 1. JSON Structured Results
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T10:30:00.000Z",
  "scenario": "application_startup",
  "status": "passed",
  "duration": 1247,
  "metrics": {
    "lcp": 1890,
    "tti": 2100,
    "cls": 0.05
  },
  "issues": [],
  "screenshots": ["startup-001.png"]
}
```

#### 2. HTML Reports
- Formatted results with visual elements

## Configuration Options

### Browser Settings
```json
{
  "playwright": {
    "browser": "chromium",
    "viewport": { "width": 375, "height": 812, "isMobile": true },
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 16_0...)",
    "timeout": 30000,
    "retries": 2
  }
}
```

### Environment Configuration
```json
{
  "environment": {
    "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo",
    "locale": "ja-JP",
    "testData": {
      "sampleUser": { "email": "test@example.com" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration with SmartThreads Development

### Development Workflow Integration
1. **Pre-Development**: Run baseline tests to establish current state
2. **During Development**: Manual trigger on major feature completion
3. **Pre-Release**: Comprehensive validation of all scenarios
4. **Post-Deployment**: Validation against production-like environment

### Requirement Compliance Mapping
- **Mobile-First Design**: UI responsiveness and touch interaction tests
- **Performance Requirements**: Automated threshold monitoring
- **PWA Functionality**: Offline capability and manifest validation
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG AA compliance verification

## Best Practices

### When to Trigger Reviews
- After implementing new UI components
- Before submitting pull requests (if pre-commit enabled)
- After performance optimizations
- Before production deployments

### Interpreting Results
- **Critical Issues**: Must be resolved before deployment
- **High Issues**: Should be addressed in current iteration
- **Medium Issues**: Can be addressed in next iteration
- **Low Issues**: Nice-to-have improvements

### Continuous Improvement
- Review historical performance trends
- Update thresholds based on user feedback
- Expand test scenarios for new features
- Incorporate user journey analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Browser Not Installed**: Run Playwright install command
2. **Application Not Running**: Ensure development servers are active
3. **Network Timeouts**: Check application startup and health endpoints
4. **Screenshot Failures**: Verify viewport configuration and UI stability

### Debug Mode
```json
{
  "debugging": {
    "enabled": true,
    "slowMo": 1000,
    "devtools": true,
    "tracing": true
  }
}
```
